Variables
Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x, y, z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.

Python Variable Name Rules

1.A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2.A variable name cannot start with a number
3.A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4.Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)


In built function:
Python has a set of built-in functions, including print(), input(), type(), id(), len(), min(), max(), sum(), sorted(), round(),, pow() abs(), range(), enumerate(), zip(), any(), all(), etc. These functions are always available to use in Python. We will learn more about these functions in the upcoming sections.

user defined functions:
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. We will learn more about functions in the upcoming sections.


Declaring Multiple Variable in a Line
We can declare multiple variables in a line. We can assign the same value to multiple variables in a line. We can also assign different values to multiple variables in a line.

Example:
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
print(x, y, z)
# Output: 1 2 3


Data Types
There are several data types in Python. To identify the data type we use the type built-in function. I would like to ask you to focus on understanding different data types very well. When it comes to programming, it is all about data types. I introduced data types at the very beginning and it comes again, because every topic is related to data types. We will cover data types in more detail in their respective sections.
