Variables
Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x, y, z), but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.
